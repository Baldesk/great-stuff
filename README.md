An incredible podcast with domain experts across AI, computer science, biology, physics, philosophy, history, economics, and more. These are not casual listens, but I enjoy nearly every episode as Lex does a tremendous job of exploring some great minds.

## Recent Updates  
Things I have recently read/watched/listened to as well as things I am currently exploring

* Yannic Kilcher's Interview with Sebastian Risi "[The Future of AI is Self-Organizing and Self-Assembling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7xpGve9QEE)" is something I continue to return to as I believe it could be a good direction for my thesis work
* Lex Fridman's interview with Jeffrey Shainline who specializes in Optoelectronic Intelligence [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwueqdgIvq4). I foung the descriptions of neuromorphic computing to be especially intersting and think the talk as a whole is insightful.
* Book by Peter RObin Hiesinger "[The Self-Assembling Brain]"(http://selfassemblingbrain.com/)
