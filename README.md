## Recent Updates  
Things I have recently read/watched/listened to as well as things I am currently exploring

* Yannic Kilcher's Interview with Sebastian Risi "[The Future of AI is Self-Organizing and Self-Assembling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7xpGve9QEE)" is something I continue to return to as I believe it could be a good direction for my thesis work
* Lex Fridman's interview with Jeffrey Shainline who specializes in Optoelectronic Intelligence [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwueqdgIvq4). I foud the descriptions of neuromorphic computing to be especially interesting and think the talk as a whole is insightful.
* Book by Peter Robin Hiesinger "[The Self-Assembling Brain](http://selfassemblingbrain.com/)"
* [Quanta Magazine](https://www.youtube.com/@QuantaScienceChannel)'s video [Could One Physics Theory Unlock the Mysteries of the Brain?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjGFp7lMi9A) which discuses
