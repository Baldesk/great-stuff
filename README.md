# Great Stuff!
## About 
A collection of great things I have come across that should be of interest to any curious mind. This serves a dual purpose as a way to share things that interest me and as a method for cataloging resources to revisit.



## Recent Updates  
Things I have recently read/watched/listened to as well as things I am currently exploring

* Yannic Kilcher's Interview with Sebastian Risi "[The Future of AI is Self-Organizing and Self-Assembling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7xpGve9QEE)" is something I continue to return to as I believe it could be a good direction for my thesis work
* Lex Fridman's interview with Jeffrey Shainline who specializes in Optoelectronic Intelligence [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwueqdgIvq4). I foung the descriptions of neuromorphic computing to be especially intersting and think the talk as a whole is insightful.
